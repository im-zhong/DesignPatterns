# Behavioral Patterns

Principle:
- 单一职责
- 引入间接性
- 封装，委托

Behavioral pattenrs are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of **resposibilityes** betwwen objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of **communication** between them.

- Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes. such as:
  - Template Method
  - Interpreter
- Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance. such as:
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Mediator
  - Observer
- Other behavioral patterns are concerned with encapsulating behaviour in an object and delegating requests to it. such as:
  - Iterator
  - Strategy
  - Command
  - State
  - Visitor
  - 

Well-designed object-oriented systems are just like this: they have multiple patterns embedded in them, but not because their designers necessarily thought in these terms. Rather, their designers have a good sense of what works well and what doesn't.
